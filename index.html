          Hello, my name is Loran Hendricks. Currently I am a Thinkful Software Engineering Immersion student. I live in Phoenix, Arizona, however, I am originally from Idaho. When I am not studying up on the latest coding frameworks I can be foound either playing videogames, rpgs, or on the golf course. I have been married for almost 3 years and I am the father to a 14-year old daughter who is a freshman in high school.

          I have been dabbling in computer programming since I was in 6th grade when I got my first computer.  Some of my best memories were scripting different IRC programs as well as trying to reverse engineer certain video games for the web. I have played organized team sports for most of my life.  I have also coached youth basketball for severals years and know exactly how to work as a member and leader of a team.
